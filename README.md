## Description

PyMaths is a Python software intended for various mathematical calculations and
conversions. This software comprises of most of the available conversion types
and units. Some other features include factorials, permutations and combinations,
trigonometric functions and trigonometric identities.

Note: This is the first time I've written unit tests for any project (never needed to do it before) and I'm still new to this,
please notify me if you find any problems in the test scripts.
